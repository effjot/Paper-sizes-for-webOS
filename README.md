=====================

A reference of ISO/DIN and North American paper size series and common photo print formats.

*Eine Zusammenfassung der DIN/ISO und nordamerikanischen Papierformate sowie gängiger Fotopapiergrößen.*

* * * * *

Did you ever wonder how large an A2 sized paper is?  Or what size “Letter” and “Legal” are?

This little app contains a list of

 * all ISO 216 / DIN 476 paper size series (A, B, C, D)

 * common North American formats (e.g. Letter, Legal, Executive)

 * ANSI and Architecture formats

 * ISO/DIN and North American envelopes

 * photo print sizes

as a handy reference list.  Dimensions can be displayed in millimetres, inches, points and pixels (different DPI values can be selected from the preferences), as well as aspect ratios.

Touch the view menu (bar at the top) to select the different paper size series.

Currently available in German and English.  If you'd like to contribute another translation, I'd be happy if you contact me.


Packages
--------

This app is available from the WebOS App Catalog, but because of the lengthy review process there, the most current, sometimes a bit “beta”, version can be found on Homebrew.

If you use the source from git, build a package with `make all`.
